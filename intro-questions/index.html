    <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
    <ol> 
        <li><p>Hi my name is Claire Cheung! I'm a senior majoring in Communication Design.</p></li>
        <li><p>I am currently pursuing a minor in Human Computer Interaction 
            and I have interests in having a career in the UX Design industry, 
            so I thought it was crucial and helpful to have basic knowledge on HTML 
            and CSS prompting me to take this classâ€”as well as it being part of my 
            major requirement.</p></li>
        <li><p>I took the Web Development Course at Washu in the Fall Semester of my
             Sophomore year, and haven't touched this topic since. So, I am basically 
             close to being a beginner on HTML and CSS because my memory on the two are
              very vague and minimal.</p></li>
        <li><p>I hope to be able to organize my code and have clear code that achieves 
            in creating a page that visually shows what I designed or planned.</p></li>
        <li><p>I think it is different in the sense that for paper you are focusing 
            on more what you can physically see and the physical experience with 
            the paper, whereas designing for the screen you are more focused on 
            the intuitive navigation and the functions that follow along with the 
            designs on the screen. Designing for the screen also requires you to 
            also deal with other factors in terms of programming to create your 
            designs and there could also be more small issues and bumps because 
            of technical difficulties.</p></li>
        <li><p>I think <a href="https://cantwait.ideo.com/">IDEO</a> has a very effective website in terms of design because the flow of navigation 
            is very smooth and intuitive. The design places the images in a very nice layout that complements
             the information the website is providing and really keeps the website to look dynamic.</p></li>
        <li><p>I think the <a href="https://www.apple.com/">Apple</a> website exemplifies effective communication as it clearly displays the different categories, information, and products Apple offers.</p></li>
        <li><p>I think  <a href="https://www.zillow.com/">Zillow</a> website works well because it allows its users, who are also their customers, to easily navigate and look for their target of needs through the website.</p></li>
