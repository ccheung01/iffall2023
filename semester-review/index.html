            <h2>Recipe Page</h2>
            <p>I developed and designed a receipe page that provides you the recipe for an Apple Crumb Pie. I wanted the design to have a similar feel and mood as an apple pie and to keep it simple to allow the focus to be placed on the recipe and supporting information.</p>

            <h2>Microsite-Designer & Developer</h2>
            <p>With my Creative Director Jude Licea, I designed and developed a website that highlights and emphasizes the superior craft and history that goes behind the Steinway and Sons pianos. My design decisions were influenced by my goals in making the website embody some key characteristics of the piano: the red highlights, the black and white theme, the sideways headers, and the hover vertical movement. The website consists of many images to allow the viewers to have a better sense of the variety of pianos Steinway and Sons have to offer.</p>

            <h2>Microsite-Creative Director</h2>
            <p>I was the Creative Director of this Chanel website and collaborated with my designer and developer Fiona Lyons-Carlson. I wanted the website to speak Chanel's brand identity, but to also make sure that the website was clear that it was an informative website and not a commercial website. I wanted the design to be a simple layout and have bold typography like the Chanel logo with a focus on images. I also told my designer to include content that also clearly highlighted the history of Coco Chanel, and the important role both Coco Chanel and Chanel had in history besides their influence in fashion history.</p>
